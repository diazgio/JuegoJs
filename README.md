## 🧐 About Memorizing. How many levels can you remember? 

- Changes from the original project of the course:

	- Code separation in files: HTML, CSS and JS.
	- Creation of 2 more divisions in the html, one for the title and one for the level counter.
	- Counter is updated while you are playing and if the game is restarted.
	
- Concept learned:
	- Declaration of variables in global and local scope.
	- Use of **const** , **let** , and **var** for different applications.
	- Use of conditionals **if**, **switch**.
	- Creation of classes with JavaScript.
	- Use of arrow functions.
